After two days of hard work [Wi≈õniowa Is Possible](https://wip-tm1.netlify.app/) team is ready to present everyone's old time favourite game - asteroids. Throughout the entire process, our primary focus was on embracing the waterfall methodologies and implementing best practices in project organization. We wrote this game using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). If you're a polish speaker you're welcome to read more about the whole process on our [blog](https://wip-tm1.netlify.app/).
